# SkyblockLib

SkyblockLib is going to be a library to make client-side modding Hypixel Skyblock
easier and more comfortable by posting Skyblock-specific events through the Forge
Event Bus, offering parsed information from the Scoreboard or Stat-Display, and more.

Based mainly on [Skyblock Addons](https://github.com/BiscuitDevelopment/SkyblockAddons)

**SkyblockLib is still in an early stage of development.**
